Frontend:
    - Truncate posts that are too long in board view
    - Error messages when thread fails to load automatically instead of redirecting to 404

Backend:
    - Moderation tools
    - Seperate login code out into its own function to simplify the OAuth flow readability
    - Finish checking for permission to access a private board on different endpoints, boards and threads are done, posts are in threads so thats fine, maybe files can work?

Shared:
    - Way to watch threads and know you are watching them (maybe some eye icon and two api endpoints, one that tells you if you're watching a thread, and one that sets watching the thread
    - Migrate to JWT instead of the current token system

Long term goals:
    - Federation? probably the ability to issue two way tokens between instances that allow access to the API endpoints for the opposite instance
    - Dockerize the whole thing including the database, initializing the DB with all the relevant functions and tables based on environment variables
    - Learn how to use the github issue tracker LOOOL
